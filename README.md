Karibu to my digital matatu, fam! This ain’t just a portfolio—it’s a wild ride through my tech hustle, with me, Ngugi Kamanu, as the tout shouting “Beba Beba!” to a billion-dollar legacy. Built with HTML, CSS, and a thermos of uji, this site’s my ticket to the big leagues. Hop on the ride! 🚌💨
🌍 What’s This All About?
This portfolio is a spiral road of innovation, where every twist and turn reveals a piece of my tech story.
